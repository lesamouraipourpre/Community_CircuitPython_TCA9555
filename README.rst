Library for TCA9555 Low-Voltage 16-Bit I2C and SMBus I/O Expander with Interrupt Output and Configuration Registers


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_
* `Register <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Register>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Installing from PyPI
=====================

.. note:: This library is not available on PyPI yet. Install documentation is included
   as a standard element. Stay tuned for PyPI availability!

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-tca9555/>`_.
To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install community-circuitpython-tca9555

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install community-circuitpython-tca9555

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install community-circuitpython-tca9555



Usage Example
=============

.. note:: T O D O Add a quick, simple example. It and other examples should live in the
    examples folder and be included in docs/examples.rst.
